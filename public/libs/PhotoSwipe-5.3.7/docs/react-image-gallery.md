Here's a basic example on how to create a simple image gallery with React. ([edit Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-gvpqsb?file=SimpleGallery.js)).

If you want to provide images data directly to PhotoSwipe, refer to [Data sources page](/data-sources).

There is also an unofficial [React gallery component by @irudoy](https://github.com/dromru/react-photoswipe-gallery) that could be very useful.
